**Features**

1. Makes it simple to scroll back and forth in a song.
2. Lets you speed up or slow down the song in one semitone
   steps. Pitch correction is optional (sometimes it is more
   distracting than just listening with the pitch shifted).
3. Lets you isolate the left or right channels, or cancel out the
   signal shared in both channels.

**TODO**

1. Add simple pitch adjustment for the many tracks where either
   musicians are out of tune or producer later change the playback
   speed.
